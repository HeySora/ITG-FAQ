                <p>
                    OpenITG is a modification of StepMania 3.95, inspired by the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Groove_(video_game)" target="_blank">In The Groove</a> series. It's an older (but still powerful, and not outdated!) version of StepMania. You can play a large catalog of (sometimes modded!) simfiles, use custom themes, and do almost everything that you can do in StepMania 5!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find modded simfiles for OpenITG, for example, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/taro4012itg" target="_blank">TaroNuke</a>'s channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/WinDEU" target="_blank">WinDEU</a>'s channel, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Puurokulho" target="_blank">PuuroKulho</a>'s channel. There are a complete database available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b630gntdn39favj/AADkDPe7aq9EE5bV7AJUCV1Ma?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h2><img alt="" src="img/nitg.png" /> What is NotITG?</h2>
                <p>
                    NotITG is a custom version of OpenITG made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/taro4012itg" target="_blank">TaroNuke</a>, that allows you (and developers) to do more things. It has been created on March 2011, and is currently very active and updated with new features!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many simfiles for that version, and there are always new ones! You can find a complete database of NotITG files <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/525k3ik8xnwpzux/AACQWrBN3WIgGRKUG2nSO57Ha?dl=0" target="_blank">there</a>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    NotITG can be downloaded on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/taro4012itg" target="_blank">TaroNuke</a>'s channel. The latest release can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/z5fnIefA22s" target="_blank">there</a>. Subscribe to him to make sure you're up-to-date!

            <div class="small-12 medium-11 large-7 columns">
                <h2><img alt="" src="img/sm5.png" /> Are they similar to StepMania 5?</h2>
                <p>
                    No, <em>No</em>, <u>No</u>, <span class="comic">No</span> and <strong class="rainbow">No!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, they are all based on Stepmania, they are all rhythm games, they have the same gameplay, but ITG and SM5 runs differently! On ITG, scripts are based on XML files, while SM5 uses Lua files. ITG uses Lua 5.0, while SM5 uses Lua 5.1. Those terms may be unknown to you, but they mean that any modded simfile from SM5 won't work in ITG, and any theme or noteskin from ITG won't work in SM5 (or vice-versa)!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So please, don't try a SM5 thing on ITG, or an ITG thing on SM5. It's just a waste of time. Of course, standard simfiles runs pretty well on both, since they read both .sm files!

                <h2>Huh?</h2>
                <p>
                    You need to know a few important things before trying to install OpenITG or NotITG :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Don't install ITG in the Program Files folder!</strong> Yes, we know that it's the default location, but that's dumb. Program Files is a folder which requires elevated privileges to write inside it. It means that you have to launch ITG as an administrator in order to play it, which is not recommended at all. You can install it anywhere else if you want to. For example, you can have a C:\Games, a folder on your Desktop, on an external drive... Everything that isn't Program Files is good!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>If it's crashing, it's not broken!</strong> If you have any issue while launching the game, just continue to read this page! You will easily and quickly fix any occuring issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Again, <strong>This is not SM5</strong>. Don't try any SM5 theme or noteskin! There also are themes for ITG, like <a href="https://youtu.be/OtcWy5m6-CQ" target="_blank">Simply Love</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/DivinElegy/GrooveNights/tree/master" target="_blank">GrooveNights</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before asking any help, <strong>make sure you read the <u>totality</u> of this page</strong>! It most likely have a solution for your problems.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you understood these things, you can now install ITG!
                </p>
